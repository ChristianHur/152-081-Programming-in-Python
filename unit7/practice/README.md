## Description
Write a program that reads a file containing text. 
Read each line and send it to the output file, 
in reverse order. 

If the input file contains:

    Mary had a little lamb
    Whose fleece was white as snow. 
    And everywhere that Mary went,
    The lamb was sure to go!

then the program produces the output file

    The lamb was sure to go!
    Whose fleece was white as snow.
    And everywhere that Mary went,
    Mary had a little lamb

Also, print the number of characters (exclude white spaces), 
words, and lines in the input file.  We will consider a 
word is one or more characters surrounded by white spaces.  

For example, the sample input file above should print:
    
    Character count: 89 
    Word count:  22
    Line count: 4
