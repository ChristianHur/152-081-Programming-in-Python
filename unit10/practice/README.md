## Description
**Inheritance**

1.  Create two Python modules called  **person.py and student.py**. Implement a superclass Person that has a first name, last name, and a year of birth. Implement a subclass called Student that extend the Person class. A student has a major and GPA. Write the declarations, the constructors, and setter and getter methods for all classes.       
    
2.  Create a main Python program module called  **college.py**. Provide the program that instantiates a Student object and test your program to make sure they work.  
      
For example:

	student = Student('Clark Kent',1995,'Journalism',4.0)     #Object instantiation and initialization  
	printResult(student)                                      #Prints the student details  
	student.setMajor('Biology')                               #Changes major to Biology  
	printResult(student)                                      #Prints the student details with new a new major
